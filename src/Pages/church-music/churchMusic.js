        <p align="justify"><span class="style2"><strong>Introduction</strong></span><br/>
          It   is eminently proper that man in his worship of God should render to Him all that   is most sublime and most beautiful and his homage can be expressed not only in   words but in sweet sounds, music, which in all true religions is an exalted   prayer, an effective expression of religious feeling.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Ethiopian Church has made her music appropriate to the   spirit of her services adapting it to the nature of the religious at which it is   used, to the season of the ecclesiastical year and to the solemnity of the   feast, making it grand and exultant on festivals of joy, and mournful in seasons   of penance and in services for the dead. Adoration, thanksgiving, supplication,   sorrow, joys and triumph are found in the zema (tone) of church music.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify" class="style2"><strong>Types of church music</strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>The Liturgy</strong><br/>
          Sacred liturgy is the very   heart of Ethiopian Orthodox worship. All the various kinds and types of Orthodox   prayer and ritual cluster around the Sacrifice of the Mass which was instituted   by the Lord the same night in which He was betrayed (1 Cor.11: 23-25).</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Ethiopian Liturgy is divided into two parts, the   introductory part called Ordo Communis and the Eucharistic part called Anaphora.   The Anaphora is the more solemn portion of the Liturgy, the central point of   which is the great Oblation. It commences with the words “Sursum Corda”, or with   their equivalents, which occur in all Liturgies, and includes the rest of the   services to the end. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">It is wrong to speak of various Liturgies of the Ethiopian   Church. It is more precise to speak of various Anaphoras. It is the anaphora,   the central part of the service corresponding to the Western Canon, which   varies, while the common framework, the Ordo Communis, as it is generally   called, remains invariable. The phrase “Qedasse of St. Dioscorus”, for example   may mean either the variable part, the Anaphora, which bears the name of that   Saint or the Ordo Communis together with the same Anaphoras. <br/>
          <br/>
          The   Anaphoras are officially fourteen, the basic one in normal use being that of the   Twelve Apostles. In the some ancient monasteries about six other Anaphoras are   used. The Ethiopic Liturgy was the first to be published of all the Oriental   Liturgies. It was printed at Rome in 1548. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Official Anaphoras:</strong><br/>
          1) Of the   Apostles<br/>
          2) Of our Lord Jesus Christ<br/>
          3) Of our Lady Mary<br/>
          4) Of St. John   Chrysostom<br/>
          5) Of St. Dioscorus <br/>
          6) Of St. John the Evangelist<br/>
          7) Of St.   Gregory the Armenian<br/>
          8) Of the 318 Orthodox<br/>
          9) Of St. Athanasius<br/>
          10) Of   St.Basil<br/>
          11) Of St. Gregory Nazianzen<br/>
          12) Of St.Epiphanius<br/>
          13) Of St.   Cyril<br/>
          14) Of James Serug <a href="englishethiopianliturgy.pdf" target="_self">(The complete Ethiopian Liturgy) </a></p>
        <p align="justify">In each of these Anaphoras the words of Institution differ. The   words of Institution in the “Liturgy Of the Apostles” are” take, eat, this br/ead   is my body, which is br/oken for you for the forgiveness of sins “ –” take,   drink, this cup is my blood, which is shed for you and for many”. The   consecration is called MELAWAT, i.e. “change”.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">These are 14 Anaphoras ascribed to various saints, but only one   is normally used, the alternate once being only for rare occasions. The normally   one, that of the Twelve Apostles, is fundamentally identical with the Coptic   Liturgy Of St. Cyril, although much more developed. The majority of these   Anaphoras are comparatively late, apparently coming after the tenth century. The   Anaphora of our Lord is used on the feasts of our Lord and on Mount Tabor; our   Lady on the feasts of our Lady Mary, Gabr/iel and Dacesius; John the Son of   Thunder on the feasts of St. John the Evangelist, St. Stephen, St. George, all   Martyrs and Christmas; John Chrysostom on vigil of Passover, Day of Our Saviour,   Feast of Cross, feast of John Chrysostom; Athanasius on Christian Sabbath;   Epiphanius on Baptism day, the month of Rains; the 318 Nicean Fathers on feasts   of Kana of Galilee, Gena, 24 Heavenly Priests; Gregory Nazianzen, Hosanna Feast   and at Passion; Dioscorus on Ascension, Pentecost; Basil, feasts of all   Patriarchs and Bishops; Cyril, on feast of Cyril the Patriarch and feasts of all   the righteous and prophets; James Serug, on St. Michael and St. Gabr/iel, all   Angels. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Liturgy is celebr/ated daily. In addition to the celebr/ant (main   priest) and at least one other priest, the presence of three deacons is   required. The Ethiopic Liturgy is an expansion of the version of St. Mark, the   rite used by the Coptic Church in Egypt. It is divided into pre-anaphora and   anaphora. Anaphora corresponds to CANON of the Mass in the Western Churches.   While the Western Churches has one anaphora (canon), the canon of the Mass with   its Preface, there are fourteen Anaphoras in the Ethiopian Liturgy. However, the   anaphora of the Twelve Apostles in the standard form in the Ethiopian Church and   the others are used on special days. </p>

        <p align="justify">While the believers assemble in the church, the priest conducts   the service of preparation. </p>
        <p align="justify">The introit is chanted while the br/ead for consecration is   br/ought from Bethlehem (Place where wine and br/ead for Mass are prepared). The   br/ead is taken in procession thrice around the altar. Wine is poured into the   chalice and offertory prayers are said.</p>
        <p align="justify">The priest chants the Doxology which is followed by St. Basil’s   prayer, the prayer of oblation and the prayer of the veil. While people   prostrate themselves the Bishop or priest says the prayer of Absolution which is   followed by the Deacon’s Litany. The blessing of the censer and offering of   incense follows. An invocation of the mother of God and praise of the Holy   Trinity are sung.</p>
        <p align="justify">The censing of the whole church and the preparatory Prayer   before the reading of the Epistle take place at the same time. The Epistle   consists of three lections. Trisagion follows and the Gospel is taken around the   altar. A litany is said by the assistant priest and the Gospel is by the Bishop   or priest. The Gospel is taken around to be kissed by the congregation. </p>
        <p align="justify">“Missa Fidelium” begins with the priest’s prayer for peace and   is followed by the Deacon’s Litany for all the faithful. The Creed is recited by   the deacon. Lavabo or priest’s washing of hands is followed by the “kiss of   peace” in the form of the people bowing to each other. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The anaphora proper begins with “sursum corda” (Lift up your   hearts): following the sursum corda and the thanksgiving for redemption   (Preface), there are the commemoration of the saints and the Intercession for   all the faithful. This is followed by the rest of the Eucharistic Prayer   including the Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy) the words of Institution, Anamnesis and   Epiklesis or invocation of the Holy Sprit for the consecration of the   element.<br/>
          <br/>
          Fraction follows and the Lord’s prayer (Pater Nostre) is said.   The prayer of penitence is said by the priest and the prayer of Intercession   follows. The priest declares, “Holy things to Holy”, elevates the host of   communion follows. Prayers of thanksgiving are said and the priest blesses and   dismisses the people. <br/>

        <p align="justify"><span class="style2"><strong>Saint Yared</strong></span><br/>
          The Deggua or hymnary   is attributed to Saint Yared, a scholar who lived in Aksum in the 6th century.   During the course of the centuries Hymns have been added by various composers.   He was caught up into paradise and there received the precepts that were to   guide him. These precepts are contained in the Mezegeba Deggua (Treasury of   Plainsongs). It is he who invented the three modes of chanting used in the   church and known respectively as geeze, ezil and ararai. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Deggua is the general name for church song. Besides the Deggua   there are other collections of hymns. We have the “Praise of Mary” and the   “Organ of the Virgin” or “organ of Praises”. Both of these are collections of   hymns in honour of the Virgin arranged for different days of the week. The   “Psalter of Christ” is another similar collection.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The Antiphony of the church is known as the Mawaset (Answers).   It consists of anthems for special festivals through out the year. The “Meraf”   also has hymns and chants for the festivals of the year. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Certain types of hymns or poems have become particularly   popular, and the Qene is one of them. There were short hymns often extemporized,   which were sung after certain verses of the Psalter. Another well-known type was   the “Salam.” The “Malkea” was a special favourite. In this type the poem   consists of numerous stanzas. In each stanza one member of the saint’s body is   greeted, e.g. the hair, the head, face, eyebr/ows, eyes, ears, cheeks, nose etc.   chanting by priests is accompanied by the beat of drums and the silvery tones of   sistrum-cymbals. The gold-embr/oidered star-ornaments on the velvet priestly   robes and br/illiant coloured ceremonial umbr/ellas gleam as the priests sway to   the measured rhythm of David’s ancient priest dance. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The instruments used in the music include the tsenatsil, a type   of sistrum, the kebero, a large drum, and a hand-bell. The three modes mentioned   are used as follows: Geeze is used for feriae (ordinary days); Ezel is used on   fast days and during Lent; and Ararai is used for principal feasts.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">In summary antiphonal chanting or singing, called “Deggua”,   forms the basic body of the music; in addition, zemaria is used when poetry is   sung as in the psalms of David, Mawaset corresponds to some extent with the   congregational responses used in western churches and Meraf is used without the   drums for ordinary daily services. These four types of singing may employ any of   three types of zema (modes of tones). The music is Middle Eastern in style and   Arabic in derivation; it is restrained, strophic, ametric and sung at very slow   tempos and organized antiphonal at a leisurely pace. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">A notable feature of this music is antiphony, sometimes between   two voices or between a solo voice and a chorus. The chorus sings in unison. On   some occasions there is true polyphony within the chorus and between the chorus   and a leader. <br/>
          <br/>
          Ethiopian church music is most expressive in its praise of   the creator and thus a worthy means for the soul to elevate itself to God.</p>

        <p align="justify"><span class="style2"><strong>Se’atat, the Horologium</strong></span><br/>
          There are   two types of Horologium, for the day and for the night. The Horologium was   composed by distinguished 15th century scholar, Abba Giyorgis of Gascha; during   the ensuing it was gradually enriched by additional hymns and prayers. In big   churches it is usual for monks, priests and deacons to conduct the Se’atat in   the northern part of the ambulatory, while the Debteras are conducting a   different service. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The book of Se’atat contains the great public prayers of the   Church, not necessarily said in public but always offered in the name of the   church. It is recited at stated hours in churches, monasteries and outside. It   is divided into seven parts known as canonical hours and each part is recited at   its own hour. These hours are known as Night, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers,   and compline. To be more exact the first of the canonical hours is night or   matins (morning office) which is followed by lauds or praises of God. These are   reckoned as one “hour”. The next division is prime or first because it is said   at “first hour” or sun rise. Then terce or third, recited at the third hour.   Sext or sixth at noon; none or ninth at three O’clock; Vespers is next,   signifying evening services, and then comes compline or the completion. </p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">The office contains psalms, discourses by the great fathers of   the church, hymns and prayers. This office is an abundant treasure of grace.   Deacons stand for the “gibr/e leilit” or night service and chant the “Se’atat” or   Book of hours, serving till dawn. There was an arrangement under which a debtera   held some church land and was bound in return to recite the Se’atat or Hours of   the night at certain times, or held land for which he was bound to recite the   “Hours of the Day” in the church. But the recital of the office is not   obligatorily imposed on priests and deacons. <br/>
