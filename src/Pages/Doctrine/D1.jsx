    </div>
    <p align="justify"><strong>I. Definition</strong><br></br>
      A Church sacrament is a holy   ordinance through which the believer receives an invisible grace under the form   of an outward sign, visible or audible. It should be instituted by Christ   Himself.<br></br>
      <br></br>
      Some Protestants say that the sacraments are mere symbols and   “signs of the new covenant,” and that they are mere outward rituals, through the   observance of which “the church of Christ confesses her Lord and is visibly   distinguished from the world.”<br></br>
      <br></br>
      But our Church believes that there is a   real efficacy in the sacraments themselves, and that they truly bring invisible   graces to the believers.<br></br>
      (1) For instance it is said that Baptism brings   salvation. ”When once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while   the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.   The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us. “(1 Pet.   3:20,21)</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) And the Holy Communion brings true life in this world:   ”Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life   in you.”(John 6:53), and brings eternal life: “Who eateth my flesh, and drinketh   my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. He that   eateth of this bread shall live forever. ”John 6:54,58)</p>
    <p align="justify">The same can be said of the other sacraments.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br></br>
        <strong>II. Number of Church Sacraments</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">(1) There are seven sacraments: baptism, confirmation, penance,   Holy Communion, unction of the sick, matrimony, and holy orders.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) The first four sacraments are necessary for every believer:   and although the other three are not necessary for every believer, yet matrimony   and holy orders are very necessary to the church, the first being necessary of   the preservation and growth of mankind, and the second for consecrating the   clergy required to perform the various church services, because they can never   be performed by the laity.</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) Other churches accept only two of these: baptism and Holy   Communion. But the following will prove that the sacraments are seven in number   and not two:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. The definition of church sacraments in general can be   equally applied to all seven without any distinction.<br></br>
      2. The Bible contains   some instructions regarding every on of the seven sacraments.<br></br>
      3. Even the   practice of those churches shows that although they accept only two sacraments,   yet they celebrate the others refusing to consider them as sacraments<br></br>
      4. The   writings of the fathers in the early centuries make it clear that they are   seven. Although they did not expressly declare that the number of sacraments was   seven, yet in their writings they mentioned each one separately; one mentioned   one r two or three sacraments, another mentioned another sacrament and so   on.<br></br>
      5. All the Orthodox and Catholic churches, throughout east and west,   agree in keeping the seven sacraments in spite of the various differences which   are among them in other respects. T hey also declare that they received the   seven sacraments from the very early fathers.<br></br>
      6. The church gives another   reason, considering that the seven sacraments resemble, or rather represent, the   seven pillars upon which “wisdom” built her house. (Prov. 9:1)<br></br>
      7. In addition   to all this, it may be worthy mentioning to state that this number of   perfection.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify"><strong>III. Performance of Sacraments</strong><br></br>
      Certain   prayers are set for each sacrament to ask for the blessing of the Holy   Ghost.</p>
    <p align="justify"><br></br>
        <strong>IV. Who has the right to perform Church   Sacraments</strong></p>
    <p align="justify">(1) A bishop may perform any church sacrament, but there must   be at least three bishops for the consecration of a bishop in the sacrament of   Holy Orders; a priest can not confer Holy Orders, but the can perform the other   six sacraments; a deacon can only help the bishop or the priest in celebrating   the seven sacraments.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Some Protestants say that sacraments and all church   ordinances can be celebrated by anyone of the laity, and that there is no need   for the clergy, supposing that all Christians are of the same standing, and   Christ did not distinguish anyone in His church.</p>
    <p align="justify">In reply please turn to what is mention in this connection in   the sacrament of the Holy Orders.</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) Others think that the sacraments lose their efficacy if the   minister’s life is not a good one. But our church teaches that the blessings got   through the Sacraments do not depend on the life of the minister because of the   following reasons:<br></br>
      1. The Apostle Paul asserts that the work of grace in the   heart does not depend on any human effort, but absolutely on God “ Neither is he   that planteth anything neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the   increase. (1 Cor. 3:7)</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">2. Though the Lord did not baptize, and baptism was left to the   disciples, yet it was said that it was He who baptized. (John 1:33; 4:1, 2)</p>
    <p align="justify"><br></br>
      In the same manner we can say that it is not the minister   who performs the sacraments, but God who works in him, with him, and through   Him. “For it is God which worketh in you.” (Phil. 2:13)<br></br>
      “We then, as workers   together with Him, beseech you also…” (2 Cor. 6:1) “ I labored more abundantly   than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was in me.” (1 Cor.   15:10)<br></br>
      “We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us:   we pray you in Christ’s stead, be reconciled to God.” (2 Cor. 5:20)</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">3. When Korah, Dathan and Abiram rebelled against Moses and   against God, took their censers and offered incense in them, they were severely   punished; but God ordered that “ the censers of these sinners against their own   souls” should be made “ broad plates for a covering of the altar, for they   offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed” (Numbers 16:37,   38)</p>
    <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="justify">4. The Lord ordered us to accept the teaching even of wicked   teachers, and not to imitate their bad example (Matt. 23:1-3)</p>
    <p align="justify"><br></br>
      5. John Chrysostom said: “It happens that the leaders are   wicked and the laity are righteous. But the grace does not depend upon the life   of the clergy. This I say in order that no one should doubt of the legality of   ordinances celebrated if he examines the priest’s life because every thing   depends upon the power of God who alone grants the race through the sacrament   performed.</p>
    <p align="justify">And St. Athanasius said: “The priest does not consecrate the   water (of baptism) but merely performs the due service, for which he obtains   grace from God.” He also said: If we baptize, confirm and forgive, everything is   due to Christ who performs it.” It was also said : It makes no difference   whether the sacraments are given at the hands of righteous or wicked ministers,   because sacraments resemble the seeds which are scattered on the earth by the   farmer, and which will produce the due crop whether the hands of the farmer are   clean or dirty; and because if the efficacy of the sacraments depends upon the   life of the minister, it follows that our salvation depends upon their   desire.”</p>
