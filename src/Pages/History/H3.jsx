  <p align="center"><strong>WORSHIP IN THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODX CHURCH</strong></p>
  <p align="right"><strong><em>Professor Sergew Hable Sellassie and Belaynesh   Mikael</em></strong></p>
  <p align="justify">The Church of Ethiopia is one of the few Churches of   Christendom where the worship of the primitive church has been preserved. This   is largely due to the geographical position of Ethiopia and to the historical   developments that led to her virtual isolation from the rest of the Christian   world from the seventh century, as a result of which Ethiopia retained the form   of worship she had received in the 4th century. It is of interest to consider   this subject in broad outline.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>1.The Place of Worship</strong><br></br>
    The noted church   historian Rufimus has provided us with information that confirms the existence   of prayer houses in Ethiopia before the introduction of Christianity as the   official religion. In the story of St. Frumentius and his brother Aedesius he   tells us that “while they lives there and Frumentius held the reins of   government in his hands, God stirred up his heart and he began to search out   with care those of the Roman merchants who were Christians and to give them   grate influence and to urge them to establish in various places conventicles to   which they might resort for prayer in the Roman manner.”<br></br>
    <br></br>
    According to   traditional sources, after the official acceptance of Christianity as the state   religion, the Emperor Ezana, the first Christian ruler of Ethiopia, built a   magnificent church at Aksum. It was supported by thirty-two monolithic columns   and had no arches. During the early Christian period old temples of pagan times   were transformed into churches. The old Sabaean temple at Yeha was made into a   church by Abba Afse, one of the Nine Saints who came to Aksum from the Roman   Empire in the 5th century. Recent archaeological excavation of the eastern   corner of this building brought to light Christian objects, such as bells and   crosses, of grate antiquity. The same can be said of the church of Abba   Pantalewon, in a suburb of Aksum. The site was once center of pagan worship;   both Sabaean and Greek gods were worshipped there. Abba Pantalewon either   transformed the ancient temple into church or else built a church upon the ruins   of the temple.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    Excavations in the area of the old Aksumite kingdom, at   Adulis and Hawlti-Melazo, have brought to light the ruins of basilicas of Syrian   type. This may be due to the influence of the Nine Saints, since the majority of   them are believed to have been of Syrian origin. An existing example of the   basilica type of church is found at the ancient monastery of Debra Damo.   According to hagiographical sources, the church was built by the Emperor Gebre   Maskal, son of Caleb, in the 6th century. During the same period a remarkable   church was built at Sana’a by Abreha, the Ethiopian viceroy of Yemen. This   church was much admired by Arab writers. It was known as al-qalis, a corruption   of Ekklesia. Abreha brought architects both from Aksum and Byzantium and they   designed a church that was marvel of architectural skill, combining the   basilicas and Byzantine styles.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    In the mediaeval period the basilica from   was retained, but underwent modification in certain cases. The amazing   monolithic churches of Lalibela are developments of this period. The churches of   Medhane Alem (Saviour of the World) and Gennet Mariam (Paradise of Mary) are   decorated by external columns of a type completely new in the architectural   history of Ethiopia. The interiors have many features in common with the old   church of Aksum. The external façade of Bete Emmanuel (Church of Emmanuel) is   reminiscent of Aksumite style of alternate recessions and projections. The   churches of Lalibela, hewn as they are out of the living rock, may be said to be   among the architectural wonders of the Christian world. The interiors are   hollowed out and decoratively and ingeniously carved, with varieties of vaulted   roofs and complex arches. Each church is constructed in a different style. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    In the late mediaeval period, ecclesiastical architecture underwent a   radical change. Churches of octagonal or circular shape were constructed. It   seems probable that these forms were increasingly adopted as Ethiopian power   moved southwards and the churches acquired the form of the round dwellings   common in the south. This type of circular or octagonal church is abundant in   the southern and western areas where Christianity was introduced later. The   basilica from has been retained to a large extent in northern Ethiopia. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    The internal structure of the circular and octagonal churches consists   of three concentric rings. The innermost part is the Maqdes or Sanctuary, also   know as the Qeddusa Queddusan or Holy of Holies, where the Tabot or Ark rests;   only priests and deacons have access to it. The Tabot represents the Ark of the   Covenant, believed to have been brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I, the son of   King Solomon. It rests upon the Menbir, which may be said to correspond to the   alter in other Churches. The sanctity of a church depends upon the presence of   the Tabot and without it services cannot be held. The blessing of the Tabot by   the Abuna constitutes the consecration of the church. On occasions when the   Tabot is removed from the church and carried in processions as on the Feast of   the Epiphany it is covered with a cloth and everyone bows or prostrates himself   to it on passing. The second chamber is the Keddist, which is reserved for   communicants, who receive the Sacrament, the women segregated from the men. Only   those who feel pure, have fasted regularly and have conducted themselves   blamelessly receive Communion. For this reason communicants are usually   babes-in-arms, infants and the very old. The third division is the outer   ambulatory which is known as the Qene Mahelet (the place of the cantors). The   Qene Mahelet is divided into three sections by curtains. The western part is   occupied by the Debteras or cantors who sing hymns and praise God to the   accompaniment of musical instruments, drums, prayer-sticks an sistra. One part   of the ambulatory is reserved for women only and one part for men. There are   three doors, to the east, north and south. The latter is used as the only   entrance by women. The other two entrances are used exclusively by men; men may   also sometimes use the women’s entrance, but women never use the men’s entrance.   Those of the congregation who feel particularly unclean ritually stand in the   churchyard throughout the service. Often there are as many people, if not more,   in the churchyard as in the church. It should be noted that the church precincts   and the surrounding wall are considered sacred, therefore those who remain   outside the church during the service are considered to have attended   church.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    A few modern city churches are built in the traditional   Alexandrine cruciform. They contain pews for the congregation. It is customary   in such churches for men and women to sit on separate sides of the church. The   traditional Ethiopian church contains no seats, however. Rush mats may be spread   upon the floor and it is customary to remove one’s shoes before entering the   church. As the services are lengthy, prayer-sticks, known as Makomiya, are   provided fot the Debteras and for elderly or important members of the   congregation to lean upon. However the truly devout may refuse to make use of a   prayer-stick during the service and a few exceptionally pious people may try to   mortify the flesh by standing upon one leg only throughout the service.</p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Church Services</strong><br></br>
    One can distinguish two   types of church service in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, indoor and outdoor.   The former is conducted in the Holy of Holies by priests and deacons. A minimum   of five persons, two priests and three deacons, is required to celebrate Mass.   In certain monasteries a minimum of seven persons is still required. The   celebrants are required to abstain from food for at least twelve hours in   advance. The sacramental bread and wine are prepared by one of the deacons in   the compound of the churchyard, in a small building known as the Bethlehem. The   times of the services depend upon fasting periods and holy days. During fasting   periods the service commences at 1 p.m. In some churches and monasteries it may   begin as late as 3 p.m. The normal duration of a service is about two hours, but   it may be lengthened or shortened upon occasions. At Easter, Mass is celebrated   at 1 a.m. and at Christmas about 4 a.m. is the usual hour. On Sundays the   service usually commences at 6 a.m., although it may start earlier and in some   monasteries and churches the usual hour is 5 a.m. In some churches in Addis   Ababa, the service now beings at 7 a.m. and at 8 a.m. on Saturdays except on   Holy Saturday when the service is conducted at midday.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The times of the   outdoor services, conducted by priests and Debteras also vary. On Sundays the   service begins at 7 a.m. until replaced by the service in the Holy of Holies.   During fasting seasons, the service commences at 6 a.m. and continues until the   beginning of Mass at 1 p.m. There is also a short service towards the end of the   Mass which consists mainly of the reciting of Qene, or verse which is epic in   type.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>3. The Types of Worship</strong></p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>a) Liturgy</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has retained the ancient service   of the Early Church and still uses the Mass of the<br></br>
    Catechumens. In the Early   Church, adults receiving instruction in the Christian Faith would attend the   Mass until the reading of the Gospel and the sermon. Then the deacon would   dismiss the Catechumens and they would leave the church. The mass is still   retained in the Ethiopian Church, though there are no longer Catechumens under   preparation for baptism. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    The real liturgy begins after the point in the   service marking the departure of those not yet baptized. The church of Ethiopia   has fourteen Anaphoras, a unique phenomenon in any Christian Church. Each is   used on special occasions to mark the observance of a particular holy day.   Through the Anaphoras differ in length and content, they have common   characteristics. They stress the Incarnations, the Last Supper, the Crucifixion   and the Resurrection. In principle the Mass is conducted in Ge’ez, the ancient   classical and liturgical language of Ethiopia. Today, however, the readings and   certain portions of the liturgy are in the vernacular, Amharic. The   congregation. Both men and women may join in the singing Choirs of the western   type are unknown in the Ethiopian Church.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>b) Se’atat, the Horologium</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">There are two types of Horologium, for day and for night. The   Horologium was composed by a distinguished 15t Century scholar, Abba Giyorgis of   Gascha; during the ensuing century it was gradually enriched by additional hymns   and prayers. In big churches it is usual monks. Priests and deacons to conduct   the Se’atat in the northern part of the ambulatory, while the Debteras are   conducting a different service.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
      <strong>c) Mahelet</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">Cantillation is an integral part of worship in the church of   Ethiopia. Hymns are sung in different modes and<br></br>
    Rhythms. The Deggua or   hymnary is attributed to Saint Yared, a scholar who lived in Aksum in the 6th   century. During the course of the centuries. Hymns have been added by various   composers. The cantors or choristers are the Debteras. On joyful occasions they   chant and sing to the accompaniment of musical instruments. Hand-clapping an   rhythmical movement of dignified and solemn kind. The rhythmic bet is marked by   the movement of the prayer-sticks carried by the Debteras. During periods of   mourning the chanting is in a melancholic mode and is not accompanied by   hand-clapping or rhythmic movements. During Lent, the use of the drum is   forbidden except on Palm Sunday. From the beginning of Lent until Palm Sunday, a   special hymn is sung called Tsome Deggua. Throughout Holy Week, special prayers   are said, accompanied by prostration, culminating on Good Friday. During this   week extensive reading from the Bible, works of the Church Fathers and Lives of   the Saints take place.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
      <strong>4. Manner of Prayer</strong><br></br>
    The Fetha Negest,   or Law of the Kings, reminds us that prayer is man’s way of communicating with   Almighty God. In prayer, man thanks God, praises Him and recognizes His domain,   confessing hid sin and seeking on his part the way of pleasing Him. The   following precepts are laid down for one who prays. Firstly, he should stand up,   as enjoined on the words of the Lord; “When you rise up for prayer; you shall   stand up.” Secondly, he should gird himself with girdle; as the Lord has said   “Let your loins be girt.” Thirdly, he should turn towards the east, for that is   the direction from which Christ will appear in His second coming. Fourthly he   should make the sign of the cross from the forehead downward and from left to   right. Fifthly he should recite the prayer in fear and trembling. Sixthly he   should kneel down and prostrate himself, since the gospel tells us that on the   night of his passion, our lord prayed prostrating himself and   kneeling.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    Prostration plays an important part in worship in the Ethiopian   church. The faithful are enjoined to begin prayer by prostrating themselves once   or thrice and to do the same at the end of prayer. At certain times kneeling or   genuflection is substituted for complete prostration, i.e. on Sundays, the days   of Pentecost, the feast days of our lord and our lady, and also after receiving   the Eucharist. On good Friday, the faithful spend the whole day at church,   usually in the courtyard, performing the act of prostration many hundreds of   times, to the limits of their physical strength.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>5. Times of prayer </strong><br></br>
    The faithful should   pray seven times each day. First upon arising from bed in the morning and before   beginning work. Secondly at the third hour; thirdly, at the sixth hour;   fourthly, at the ninth hour; fifthly, the evening prayer; sixthly, the prayer   before sleep and lastly, the midnight prayer.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The morning and evening   prayers should be said in church, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. Anyone   who omits prayer, unless he is ill, should be cut off from the congregation of   the faithful. Anyone who is sick should attend church if he possibly can, for he   may be healed. The other prayers should be said at home. When the hour for   prayer arrives and one of the faithful finds himself in a place where he cannot   pray, he should pray mentally.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>6. Fasting </strong><br></br>
    In the Fetha Negest* fasting is   defined as follows:<br></br>
    “ Fasting is abstinence from food, and is observed by man   at certain times determined by law, to attain forgiveness of sins and much   reward, obeying thus the one who fixed the law. Fasting (also) serves to weaken   the force of concupiscence so that (the body) may obey the rational soul.” <br></br>
    <br></br>
    Fasting is strictly observed by all faithful members of the church.   There are approximately 250 fast days in the year, although not all of these are   compulsory for everyone. The average person may fast about 180 days in the year.   There are seven official fasting periods for Ethiopian Christians.<br></br>
    1. All   Wednesday and Fridays, except for the 50 days after Easter. <br></br>
    2. The Lenten   fast of 55 days.<br></br>
    3. The Nineveh fast of 3 days.<br></br>
    4. The vigils, or gahad of   Christmas and epiphany.<br></br>
    5. The fast of the apostles; this varies in length,   depending upon the date of Easter, and maybe a minimum of 14 days and maximum of   44. This fast commemorates St. peter and St. Paul. <br></br>
    6. The fast of the   prophets of 43 days.<br></br>
    7. The fast of the assumption, 15 days in august.<br></br>
    Of   these fasts, the fast of the apostles and the fast of the prophets are   compulsory for clergy only, although they are also observed by many of the   faithful. All the other fasts are considered obligatory for all devout   Christians, except children under seven. During fasting periods, Christians   abstain from meat and all animal products: meat, milk, butter and eggs. No food   or drink is taken before noon, at the earliest: even then only a simple repast   should be taken. Pregnant women, the seriously sick and travelers are exempted   from fasting. In Holy Week no food is taken before 1 p.m. or later. The really   devout fast completely from Good Friday till Easter Sunday, while others eat   only the evening meal on these days.<br></br>
    The Lenten fast is traditionally broken   by a joyful feast that takes place after midnight mass, at about 3 a.m., or the   first cock- crow or Easter Sunday morn. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>7. Holidays or feasts</strong><br></br>
    Nine major and nine   minor holy days are observed in the church of Ethiopia. All are connected with   events in the life of Christ. </p>

Other important holy days are those in commemoration of St.   Michael and St. Mary and of the grate religious reformer, the Emperor Zar’a   Ya’iqob. No less than thirty-three holy days are devoted to St. Mary. An   indication of the special veneration attached to the Blessed Virgin in Ethiopia.   A feature of feast days in the Ethiopian Church is that many of them are   commemorated monthly and not only annually. As in the rest of the Christian   world Sunday is observed as a day of rest. In former times Saturday, the   Biblical Sabbath, was also observed. On holy days believers are expected to   refrain form heavy labor and manual tasks, such as farming, forging metal and   weaving. Various transactions are permitted, however. On these days ot os   customary to carry out charitable and philanthropic acts, to visit the sick or   those in prison and to arrange reconciliation between those who have quarreled.   Sundays and other holy days are also occasions of social events, weddings,   dancing and sport.</p>
