  <p align="center" class="style1">THE ETHIOPIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH SCHOOL SYSTEM</p>
  <p align="right"><strong><em>By Haile Gebriel Dagne</em></strong></p>
  <p align="justify">The educational system in Ethiopia has been profoundly molded   by the past. Traditional education derives its distinctive character from the   unique Christian heritage of the country. Ethiopia is, after all, the only   African country to have preserved Christianity as its religion for over a   millennium and a half. Moreover, having its own written language and literature   it developed from very early days a tradition of ecclesiastical scholarship. The   long monastic tradition dates beck to the fifth century and the significant role   of monasticism in the diffusion of Christian learning during the mediaeval   period has been described in an earlier chapter. In the Christian highlands of   Ethiopia, the Church constituted the main guardian of traditional culture and   provided the only schools in the land for many centuries. Not only did it   preserve its ancient tradition with tenacity and convey it to future generations   but it also secured remarkable continuity that has lasted to the present day.   For the authority of tradition in present day Ethiopia remains compelling and   forceful.<br></br>
      <br></br>
    The church school system has been the instrument that has   preserved the traditional learning of Ethiopia and conveyed it faithfully to   succeeding generations. The priests and Church scholars who are the bearers and   propagators of traditional learning have themselves been formed in the church   school system that we propose to examine in some detail. For, in spite of the   inevitable changes taking place in Ethiopia with the steady expansion of modern   secular education in the present century, church schools still play an active   part in the Ethiopian educational scene. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    The church school system, which   is one of the oldest in Christendom, originated in the Aksumite Kingdom with the   introduction of Christianity about the 4th century. In the course of the   centuries the school system has grown and changed in many ways. With the   expansion of the Kingdom and Christianity to the south and southwest, churches   and monasteries were founded, which became for centuries important centers of   learning.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    In their present form the church schools evolved during the   “golden age” of the Church from the 13th to the 16th centuries when the   literature of the Church had reached its peak. After the great wars,   particularly after the 17th century, cultural activities declined. From that   time to the present the church schools have undergone little change. The schools   have in this period confined their educational activities to glorifying the   products of past centuries and conveying these to the coming generation. We   shall not discuss here the historical development, but rather the educational   activities of the schools, as we know them today in the country.<br></br>
    The church   school system has the following divisions:<br></br>
    1) Nebab Bet (Reading   school)<br></br>
    2) Qedasse Bet (Liturgy school)<br></br>
    3) higher schools, namely <br></br>
    a)   Zema Bet (Music school) <br></br>
    b) Quene Bet and (Poetry school)<br></br>
    c) Metsehaf Bet   which again have different subdivisions. (Literature school)</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>1) The Nebab Bet</strong><br></br>
    The Nebab Bet, the Reading   School or the “House of Reading” is the first stage of the traditional schools,   where primary instruction is given. We find the Nebab Bet in practically all   churches and monasteries, in a number of villages and in the compounds of   well-to-do landlords. It is a one-teacher school, with instruction given by a   priest or layman with church education. It is difficult to estimate the number   of Nebab Bet in the country or to evaluate the school population involved.   According to the Church Office there are about 15,000 churches in Ethiopia. If   each church has one Nebab Bet, which is probably the case, then there are at   least 15,000 one-teacher schools.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Each Nebab Bet may have an average of 20 pupils. We may then be   justified, with some reservation, in saying that at present the total Nebab bet   enrolment might well be 300,000. This does not include pupils receiving   instruction in the village schools and in private compounds. Normally children   start school between the ages of 5 and 7, when they are traditionally considered   ready to learn. Theoretically, both boys and girls and members of all ethnic   groups and classes are eligible to enroll in church schools. However, in rural   districts, parents generally discouraged the education of girls, since their   function is to be housewives, and for this role no formal education is felt to   be necessary. Non-Christian families are reluctant to send their children to a   Nebab bet because it is closely integrated with the church. Therefore, the Nebab   bet and the church schools as a whole can not be considered to serve the entire   population, but only members of the Orthodox Christian Church.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The prime function of the Nebab bet is to teach children to   read religious books, practically all of which are in Geez. Instruction in the   Nebab bet consists almost exclusively of reading. Children master the 231   letters of the Geez syllabary, and are drilled in the art of good reading.   Traditionally writing is not taught, since this was not needed in everyday life,   unlike reading which is necessary for daily prayers and participating in the   church service. In urban centres and roadside towns the Nebab bet has a new   function today. The modern schools often accepts more readily in their primary   grades those children who can already read and write. This limitation of the   enrolment is mainly due to the large number applicants and to an insufficient   number of schools, so parents, especially those who do not need the labour of   their children, are obliged to send their children to the Nebab bet as a first   step to enrolment in a modern government school. </p>
  <p align="justify">The instruction in the Nebab bet is given in three different   stages:<br></br>
    a) Fidel (Alphabets) Instruction<br></br>
    b) Drill in the reading of   various religious texts<br></br>
    c) Reading of the Psalm of David </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>a) Fidel Instruction</strong><br></br>
    The first subject of   study for the child is the set of Ge’ez letters, known as the Fidel. In earlier   times the letters were written on a roll of parchment, which the pupil carried   with him. When he was studying a particular part of the Fidel the student   unrolled the parchment and fixed the two-ends of the roll on a wooden stick with   a piece of cloth or string. Today children use a printed table of letters, which   is glued on a single sheet of cardboard. This is available for about ten cents   in every market place in the country, so that the traditional parchment is   disappearing. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    What is the process of learning the letters? The child,   who is led by his teacher or a monitor, touches with a straw each letter from   left to right of the table and names the letter in a loud voice. He repeats this   for months. Usually the child learns the whole set of letters in sequence by   heart, so that in reality he may not be able to distinguish on letter from the   other. As a next step to help him distinguish individual letters, he is led to   pronounce each letter reading from right to left and then from top to bottom.   This process is known as Qutir, i.e. “learning by counting each letter”. The   large number of characters (33 in 7 orders) with the differences and   irregularities of the related sets are not easily grasped by the beginner. To   help the child distinguish the different characteristics of the alphabet another   table has been prepared. On such tables the number of the letters and the forms   in the seven orders remain the same, but the place of the characters is changed   or mixed up, so that the child cannot depend only on his memory and the sequence   in which he has memorized the characters. Today the standardized table “Aa, Bu,   Gi, Da “ is much used, however, so that the pupil may learn even this by heart   and only comes to distinguish the individual characters well after much   practice.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    When the pupil knows the letters to some extent, he starts to   practice reading a text. Generally, the first epistle of St. John is used for   the purpose. The child uses four methods to practice reading this text known as   Fidel Hawaria or the first Epistle of St. john, first he pronounces every letter   of the word pointing at each letter with a straw (Qutir-method). He repeats this   pronunciation exercise on the same text several times. When he is able to   distinguish the letters he passes to the next drill known as Ge’ez, i.e. the   beginning of reading. Here the student attempts to put the letters together in a   chanting form and read them as a word. The same process is repeated for several   days or even months. When the teacher feels that his pupil has mastered this   stage, he leads him to “Wurdnebab”. Now the child practices read learns to take   much care over words that must be read to together, the accents, the pauses and   the soft or hard pronunciations of the syllables. This step is important, so the   pupil spends more time on it. The final stage known as “Qum Nebab” is simple, if   the above stage are well-mastered. Here the child practices reading at a very   lively pace, but without mistakes. The four steps are repeatedly drilled on the   same text, Fidel Hawaria. The exercise of reading can be quite difficult for the   beginner, particularly because the text is in Ge’ez, a language no longer spoken   and therefore far from the experience of the child. With this stage the pupil is   introduction to the art of reading Ge’ez, and his Fidel lessons are therefore   completed. He can then practice reading different religious texts.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>b) Reading lessons from religious books</strong><br></br>
    The   number and the kind of books the student has to read at this stage is not   standardized. All depends on the availability of books. Traditionally, teachers   in different areas select any text for reading. The following texts are known to   have been used in different areas: Gabata Hawaria, i.e. selected epistles of St.   Paul, St. James, and St. Peter; the Gospels, usually the Gospel of St. John is   used as a text for exercise; Arganon: praises of St. Tamara Mariam: the miracles   and wonder of St. Mary; Paulos: the epistles of St. Paul; Tamara Iyasus: the   miracles of Jesus; the Acts of the Apostles, etc. Pupils need not understand the   texts of these books, but they have to be able to read them well, since thee are   the books read in the church service, where young boys serve as readers,   deacons, and later on as priests. The methods of practicing the reading are   those described under the Fidel Hawaria, namely, Qutir, Ge’ez, Wurdnebab, and   Nebab.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">When the pupil is able to read a text, he starts a new lesson   known in Amharic as Yemata Timhirt, i.e. an evening lesson, or Yeqal Timhirt,   i.e. memorization. Every evening he has to memorize the daily prayers. In the   evening the pupils come to the house of the teacher, which is also at the same   time the school itself’ All stand around the teacher while the lesson is given.   The teacher or an advance student recites to the pupil sentence by sentence or   verse-by-verse the standard prayer the child has to memorize. The pupil then   repeats the sentence till he knows it well. This exercise is repeated for months   or every a couple of years, until the boy knows the main prayers by heart. In   some cases the Ethiopic catechetical book, the Aemade Mestir (Columnae Mister),   particularly Mistere Sellassie (on the Trinity), is taught in Amharic. All other   texts are in Ge’ez. Since the pupils do not understand the texts, the   memorization drills are very exacting in energy and time. When the teacher is   convinced from his daily observations that his pupil had mastered the reading   exercises, he lets him start to learn the reading of the Psalms.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>C) Reading the Psalms</strong><br></br>
    The pupil now learns   to read the psalms, the most important devotional book of Ethiopian Christians.   The method he uses is the chanting from and the Wurdnebab reading process. After   repeating the entire book of Psalms several times using Wurdnebab, he continues   reading for months, even over a year, using the Qum-Nebab reading method. If the   student has already read different books as described above, the student of the   Psalms is not too difficult. In some cases students are made to memorize the   texts of the Psalms. This is particularly important for those students who plan   to continue on the higher learning, since passages from the Psalms are used   frequently in the hymns and poems of the church. Gradually the pupil masters the   art of good reading. The teacher normally does not set a formal examination to   judge the work of the pupil. However, he follows the progress of his student   daily, so no special tests are needed.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    When he is convinced that the   pupil has reached the level of knowledge traditionally required at this stage of   learning, he indicated that the time has come when he may leave the Nebab Bet.   This is considered one of the most important events in the life of the pupil. It   is also an occasion of joy for the family, and the parents usually organize a   feast to mark the event.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    A reader of the psalms enjoys certain privileges   as one of the elite in his village. He may be called upon to read and write   letters. At certain ceremonies he may recite prayers, if no priest is available.   The girls from traditional families who have attended the school usually marry   before or shortly after they complete the lessons in the House of Reading.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>2. Qedasse Bet--- The training of the altar   priest</strong><br></br>
    Some of the pupils who complete the Nebab Bet join a Qedasse   School, one of the schools are the liturgy. A teacher specialized in Qedasse or   the Mass is to be found in practically all the main churches. A teacher   specialized in this branch of the liturgy teachers the Gebre Diquna and Gebre   Qissina, i.e. the functions of deacon and of a priest in the liturgy. Children   of the clergy, who use church lands usually enter such schools in order to   become deacon or priests in a church (and thus keep their church land in the   hands of the family). The office of a priest is particularly attractive to   tenants or landless peasants, because a priest in his area enjoys privileges,   and his office entitles him to possession of the land known as Semon land. The   function of an altar priest is limited to carrying out the rituals of the Mass   and the Sacraments. For this purpose scanty training suffices. A Qedasse teacher   normally teaches only the hymns which a deacon or a priest has to use in the   liturgy of the Church. The rest, including the teaching the traditions and   service of the Church, is learned through daily experience in the parish itself.   Usually a candidate for his training is attached to a priest or monk to whom he   gives certain services, accompanying him on visits of families, festivals, and   ceremonies in and outside the parish. Through observation or day-to-day practice   and instruction by his priest-master, the boy learns the Church activities and   functions of a deacon and of a priest. The activities of the priest, therefore,   are limited to the rituals, which do not usually demand the understanding of the   Scriptures. Thus relatively little education is expected from a young man to be   ordained an altar priest. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>3. The higher schools of the church</strong><br></br>
    We have   seen that the Qedasse bet trains mainly the altar priests, who are known as the   semonegna (those who serve weekly). These are the only members of the clergy who   are allowed to celebrate the mass and administer sacraments. However, before and   after the mass there are readings of the scriptures, ritual dance, and long   hymns and poems. To be able to carry out this further service one has to attend   a higher school of the church, which should be considered an extension of the   Nebab and Qedasse Bet. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    The leading teachers and scholars of the church,   who are known as Debtera, are trained in the higher school. A Debtera is a   general term given to all those who have completed one of the higher schools of   the church. Theoretically, priests and monks can also be characterized as   Debtera, if they have completed studies in one of the higher schools. In   practice however, few fall into this category, and these few are not usually   known as Debtera. The majority of the Debtera are laymen, and as such they are   not allowed to serve in the mass and the administration of sacraments. Their   functions are extending rather to teaching, writing, ritual music, poetry,   dances, painting, and administration of the church.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    A student of the   Nebab Bet or Qedasse Bet, who would like to join the higher schools, usually   leaves his parents and joins the wandering students who travel from parish to   parish and form monastery to monastery. Traditionally a boy can receive only the   Nebab Bet instruction while he is at home. The main reason for wandering in   search of schools and teachers is that in rural areas any higher education is   not possible for a youth who remains with his parents, except in a few cases of   Debtera families. The heavy demands of cultivation and cattle tending force the   parents to demand the services of their children. Besides this, the student is   attracted by the adventurous and romantic life of a begging and wondering   student, about whom much is spoken and fabulous stories are told. Wandering   students usually come from farming and clerical families – very few are from the   higher classes.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    With the spread of modern education and a modern school   system this institution is declining. Fewer young people are motivated to study   in the higher church schools. One of the main reasons for this change is that   the graduates of the church schools have lost their traditional elite status in   the social order, which today particularly in the modern sector, is being   occupied by those who have a modern western type of education. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    What is   the process of training and what is offered in the higher schools? The main   courses of study are in church music, church poetry, and religious literature,   each divided according to content of instruction<br></br>
    <br></br>
    In all these schools the   students must learn the material by heart. To demonstrate this we should   describe the average study day at the Zema Bet. The teacher of Zema sits in the   middle of his pupils, who are practicing their daily assignment of the hymns   individually or in-groups. Each group sings from a single text, or one of the   groups sings and the rest observe him. The more advanced students serve as   monitors to instruct the beginners. When one of the students has mastered the   hymn, he goes and sings before the teacher. The teacher either approves and   gives the student a new assignment or orders further practice on the same text.   The lessons advance in this manner day after day until the student finishes the   fixed text of the hymn and knows it by heart.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The training challenges the   memory of the child rather than leading him to think. In spite of the monotony   of the learning and teaching methods and the exacting length of time, the   students show surprisingly high morale. There are ofcourse reasons for their   diligence. The wandering student expects a high position in the church   hierarchy. Furthermore, since the instruction is considered sacred, just as   prayer is, the student takes his assignment seriously. The resulting high morale   in the school community helps the individual student to adapt himself to the   hard work. The usually strict demands of the teachers are accepted with out   hesitation, because the wandering student has come to the school of his own free   will and has willingly submitted himself to the authority of the teacher. If he   is not satisfied, he can leave the school and look for another one. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>b) Qene Bet</strong><br></br>
    There are Qene forms or models   that the student has to master in order to be able to compose the Qene poems   which are sung in different sections of the liturgy of the church or used to   celebrate church and state ceremonials. About nine models are famous in the   Samenna Worq (wax and gold) Qene system. There are also other Qene types which   are however not as widespread as the Samenna Worq.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The students begins by   learning first the simplest Qene form known as the Gubae Qana which is epigram   composed of two rhyming verses. He then learns Ze’amlakiye (3 verses), Wazema (5   verses). Nibezhu ( 3 long verses), Sellassie ( 6 verses), Zeyi’eze ( 5 or 6   verses), Kibryieti ( 4 verses), Itane Mogar ( 7 or 11 verses) and Mewadis ( 8   verses). These are most widespread but there are other forms, e.g. in Gojjam,   the Gonji and Washera schools of Qene differ from this.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The student   learns Qene with more interest and motivation than the other disciplines, such   as Zema. There are several reasons for this. The main one is that the student   understands the Ge’ez language in the Qene school. The teaching method allows   the boy free activities and movements as illustrated below. In the student an   aesthetic interest is developed, or at least awakened. The following   illustration may make this clear.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The Qene lessons usually start in the   afternoon or in some places early in the evening. The place of instruction is   usually a communal hut near the teacher’s dwelling known as the Mahber Bet, or   simply in the open or under a tree. First there is a prayer to be recited. The   teacher may then make some remarks on the students’ work for the day. As the   main task of the session some Ge’ez verbs are conjugated, and the proper usage   of selected verbs and nouns is demonstrated by examples from different Qene   verses composed by the teacher and advanced students on the spot. The story or   legend of the saint whose feast is to be celebrated on the next day is then   narrated; this comprises the theme of the Qene composition by the students,   using the vocabulary and grammar already discussed at the session. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    During the evening the student endeavours to find the proper music to   fit the Qene model he is going to compose; since all Qene has to be sung, his   Qene piece must be suited to a corresponding musical form. The next day the   student looks for a secluded place and meditates on his composition. When he has   composed his Qene verse after the model assigned to him by the teacher, he then   approaches the teacher, who sits for the most part of the day at a place known   to all. The teacher is usually engaged in some individual work such as reading,   copying a manuscript, or even doing some handwork.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    The student recites   the product of his intellectual labour. The teacher either accepts the verses or   the offers critical comments and sends the student back for further meditation,   students come at intervals to the teacher to recite in the manner.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    In the   afternoon the session or Gubae takes place again. The work of the day is first   reviewed, in which a lively discussion is usually generated.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    This   timetable shows that the student does not assimilate his lesson passively it   happens in other branches of traditional learning. He has the opportunity to   discuss the theme given, which challenges his intellect. He should not, however,   contradict or be critical of religious and other accepted values. The student   strains his power of expression to construct the Qene verses in a vivid,   enigmatic manner or to express his experience in social life in connection with   biblical stories, visions, and legendary events.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    One could say that in   the Qene School the content of learning covers practically all aspects of the   values of the traditional social system in which the student lives. The Qene   School is perhaps the only school where the students can received both   intellectual and traditional training. It is generally recognized that the most   able clergy of the Church are those trained in the Qene School. The main   interest and purpose of the school is, however, not to develop poetic and other   aesthetic interests in the child or youth, but to enable him to carry out the   Church rituals. A graduate of Qene School looks for a position in a Church and   serves in the choir where he composes Qene and sings, or he may take a post as a   minor teacher or administrator in the Church. Those who want to study further   may join the next school, the Metsehaf Bet. To specialize in Qene so as to be a   teacher in a higher school, the student must attend several schools and study   more branches of Qene, which means studying and wandering for some years   more.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>c) Metsehaf Bet</strong><br></br>
    This is the general term   for the School of Commentaries composed of four branches. The first type is   known as Beluy. The 46 Books of the Old Testament are studied and commented   upon. The second branch is the Haddis, a specialized school on the commentaries   of the 35 Books of the Ethiopian New Testament. The third branch is Liqawent,   which presents studies and comments on the various writings of the Church   Fathers, e.g. Saint John Chrysostom, Qerlos and others. The canon law (Fetha   Negest) as well as the calendar calculation (Bahre Hasab) are also studied here.   The last branch of the Metsehaf Bet is the Menekosat, the School of Commentaries   on monastic literature. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    In these specialized branches the students   learns the traditions of the Church, theology, Church history and laws, through   the interpretation of the various individual writings. The commentaries of these   teachings do not proceed under systematic theological or historical categories,   but when each sentence or phrase of a text is interpreted, depending on the   content, theological, moral and historical questions are raised, discussed, and   developed. The student has to learn each sentence of the commentary by heart.   The following is a typical example of a Metsehaf Bet lesson<br></br>
    <br></br>
    Students come   to the teacher in a group of three or four, all studying the same text. One of   the group reads a sentence or a phrase. The teacher first translates the   sentence into Amharic and then comments on it. The students listen attentively   and try to remember the comment word for word. When this group leaves the   teacher, another group or individual comes to read to the teacher and hears his   commentary. After leaving the teacher each group moves apart and tries to   comment on the text just as the teacher did, as much as possible word for word.   If one misses a word or an idea, another member of the group recalls it and   supplements. After some time the group goes again to the teacher and reads the   same text and again comments on it. This way the group can compare its progress   to know how far it had grasped the interpretation of the previous time. <br></br>
    <br></br>
    This memorization of the commentary of the books exacts many years of   exercise and labour, which the adult student is ready to accept. A graduate of   the Metsehaf Bet enjoys high prestige as a scholar and can take a high post in   the Church hierarchy, such as head of a monastery (Gedam) or a large church   (Debre). This hope is perhaps one of the motives that encourages the student to   spend more that half of his life at such a school. At this stage memorization is   not felt as a burden by the student, because ever since his early days in the   Nebab Bet he has developed his powers of memorization.<br></br>
    <br></br>
    One important   reason memorization is so stressed all through the Church Schools is that   writing materials were traditionally not well developed. The few handwritten   manuscripts on parchments were, and still are, very expensive. Aside from the   Authoritarian tradition there is another consideration; the student is not   allowed to have a critical opinion about any text to be commented upon, since it   is believed that God revealed the content to the Fathers through the Holy Sprit.   Therefore, these patristic writings are not to be considered critically, but   simply learnt by heart. The habit of memorization and the uncritical acceptance   of the commentary condition the mode of thinking of the student.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In this way the historical interpretations are mixed with   legendary tales and special natural events, all considered to be miracles, and   even concrete phenomena are given symbolical meanings. The expressions are   vividly illustrated with parables, analogies, proverbs, and popular wisdom.   Parallels are quoted from the history of the country while interpreting the   passages on the Holy Land. Generally, the approach to reality is well mixed with   mythical attitudes.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">These schools of commentaries are not to be found everywhere,   but in large churches, Debre, and in monasteries, Geddam, where extensive   libraries and famous teachers are to be found. It may be that church schools as   a whole will take on a new impetus and play an important role in raising the   general level of education of the clergy in the future.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The church schools that have been described above provide the   continuation of traditional education in Ethiopia. Modern education, of recent   origin, is provided mainly in schools operated by the Government. However, in   the urban centers and roadside towns the elementary church school, the Nebab Bet   is flourishing as an institution to prepare pupils for Government schools,   teaching young children literacy in Amharic. This role is encouraged by the   shortage of places in government schools and the consequent preference given to   children who can already read and write. Such schools may perhaps play a wider   role within the context of the national campaign for literacy and provide more   instruction for adults as well as young pupils.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">It should be noted that the Church is fully aware of the   necessity to train its own future leaders in such a way that they will fulfill   their role in modern society. Modern theological colleges exist which combine   traditional studies with the broader curriculum demanded in the twentieth   century. A number of theological students have also progressed to further   advanced studies abroad.
