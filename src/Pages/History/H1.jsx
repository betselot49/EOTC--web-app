  <p><strong>The rise of Islam and its impact on Ethiopia </strong></p>
  <p align="justify">The period following the rise and the rapid expansion of Islam   in the near and the Middle East was a very critical one for the Christian   kingdom of Axum. The whole civilization and culture of Axum, as well as its   economic life, was based on its international maritime connections, Ever since   the Ptolemeys had taken a scientific and economic interest in the Red Sea area,   Axum had become an integral part of the Hellenic world. Axum held the same   position also during the Roman and Byzantine Empires. It was indeed not a mere   coincidence that the Church in Axum was established immediately after the   Emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion of his Byzantine   dominions. There seems to be no doubt, now, that there were many individual   Ethiopian and foreign Christian’s residing in the Aksumite kingdom, even before   the formal establishment of the Church there. But the crucial step taken by   Ezana to adopt the new religion and to make it a state Church followed upon a   similar imperial decision by Constantine. It was also from the Eastern   Mediterranean that the first Christian missionaries come to Axum. Abuna Salama   and others such as the Nine Saints came from the Byzantine world, and endowed   the Aksumite Church with its earliest characteristics. These regular contacts   continued down to the seventh century, and all-important economic, political,   and religious developments in the Byzantine world were also reflected in Axum.   With the rapid Muslim conquest, however, these historical channels of   communication were almost completely cut off. Only with the Alexandrian Church   did Christian Ethiopia continue to have precarious contact.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Before the rise of Islam, Axum was an extensive maritime and   commercial Empire. In its heyday, it ruled many districts in the southwestern   part of the Arabian Peninsula, across the Red Sea. It controlled the land of the   Beja, a people who inhabited northern Eritrea and what northeastern part of the   Republic of the Sudan. In the west, the political and military sphere of   influence of Axum had already reached the Nile valley by the fourth century A.D.   Beyond the River Takazz’e, the district of Semien and probably also the region   as far as Lake Tana were within its territorial limits. However, it was in the   south, in the predominantly Agew populated areas of Tigrai, Wa’ag, Lasta, Anogot   and Amhara where the heritage of Axum struck its deepest roots. When almost   completely excluded from the Red Sea trade, and having lost its maritime   international orientation, the kingdom of Axum turned towards this Agew   interior, and made it the center of a distinctive Christian culture over the   centuries.<br></br>
      <br></br>
    The rulers of Axum had acquired strong footholds in these   central highlands already before the establishment of the Christian Church in   the kingdom. They sent numerous expeditions of war and conquest into these areas   from where they obtained tribute and a continuous supply of ivory, gold, and   slaves. The Aksumite governor of the Agew was responsible for the long-distance   caravan route to Sassou-some where near Fazolgi in eastern Sudan –from where   Axum obtained much gold. These precious commodities were used for the   international trade across the Red Sea in which Aksum was most active. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">After their conversion to Christianity the kings of Aksum   consolidated their power by establishing churches and military colonies in these   central highlands. There are still today a number of churches many of them dug   out of the living rock in Tigrai and Lasta-which are attributed to the early   Christian kings of Aksum. These churches and military settlements became centers   of still further movements of small family groups from the more crowded parts of   northern Ethiopia. In this way, the areas as far south as the region of northern   Shoa were gradually affected by these slow population movements. Local   traditions indicate that already in the tenth and eleventh centuries a number of   small isolated Christian families had been established in the districts of Menz,   Merhabite, Muger, and Bulga in northern Shoa. The spear head of Aksumite   expansion may have even further south and east. This seems to be suggested by   the geographical distribution of some of the Semitic languages of   Ethiopia-Amharic, Argobba, Harari, Guragi, and Gafat. <br></br>
      <br></br>
    All these regions   in which the Aksumite were expanding were originally pagan lands, and the people   spoke different Cushitic language. We have no historical data to show how these   people lived, and how they were socially and politically organized before the   advent of Aksumite rule. When the Aksumite conquered them, however, they imposed   upon them their own religion, language, and Political organization. It was this   Aksumite impact on the Agew and Sidama interior of the Ethiopian region which   resulted in the creation of a number of small, predominantly pagan kingdoms of   which we have distant echoes in the traditions of early and late mediaeval   Ethiopia. Among these, were the political units of the Athagaw (=Agew) mentioned   in the inscriptions the Aksumite kings against whom fought long wars of   resistance; the Semenoi (that is, the ancient people of Semien) who also fought   against, and were conquered by the Aksumite; the pagan kingdom of Gojjam, (also   of Agew extraction),which was only integrated into the Christian Kingdom of   Ethiopia in the fourteenth century; and the legendary kingdom of Damot (probably   inhabited by Southern Cushitic or Sidama peoples),which was still very strong   between the tenth and thirteenth centuries in the whole region south and   south-west of Shoa.</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong><br></br>
  The beginnings of the Zagwe’   Dynasty<br></br>
    </strong>One of these political units, the kingdom of   Bugna in Lasta, later emerged in the twelfth century as the most dominant single   power in the region, and took control of the inland Empire that was once ruled   by Aksum. The new rulers are collectively known as the Zagwe Dynasty in   Ethiopian history and the y ruled the world of the Christian kingdom until the   last quarter of the thirteenth century. The power of Aksum had declined, and her   commercial supremacy in the Red Sea area had been taken first by the Persians   and later by the huge Muslim Empire which dominated the whole of the near and   Middle East and Northern Africa. The descendants of the ancient rulers of Aksum   thus lost their Red Sea ports and much of the semi- desert coastal strip, and   they seem to have concentrated their attention on their inland provinces south   of Aksum. Even Aksum was apparently abandoned as a political center by the ninth   century, and the center of gravity of the Christian kingdom moved to the region   of southern Tigrai and what is today northern Wollo. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">For about three centuries this area remained the center of the   kingdom, which revived, once again, with a new identity as a land-locked   Christian Empire. It entered a new period of conquest and expansion, and,   according to an Arab historian of the tenth century, its political sphere of   influence reached the region of Harar and Zeila. The same historian tells us,   however, that in the middle of the same century the kingdom had suffered a   number of military reverses, and the southern part of its territory was   conquered by an apparently pagan queen, the queen of the Banu al-Hamuiyya, who   had diplomatic and commercial relations with the Muslim kingdom of Yemen. The   new political situation seems to have brought about a period of decline and   internal conflict in the Christian kingdom. But the kingdom held on in the   northern part of its territories unit the new Zagwe rulers took over in the   middle of the twelfth century as we have mentioned earlier.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The term “Zagwe dynasty” means the dynasty of the Agew. As   already stated above its rulers came from the district of Bugna, in Lasta. Their   homeland was apparently one of the most important strongholds of the Agew people   in their centuries-old relations with the Semitized Agew kingdom of Aksum. It   was probably here that the armies of ancient Aksum were confronted with very   strong movements of resistance when they were expanding southwards. It was also   probably here that the Aksumite governor of the Agew had his headquarters from   where he protected the long-distance gold trade of Aksum in the sixth century.   All the dialectical groups of the Agew peoples consider this region as the land   of their ancestors, and as a point of dispersal in their traditions of   population movements. It was therefore not accidental that the Agew dynasty of   Christian Ethiopia should emerge from precisely the same area.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Agew people of Wa’ag and Lasta had already been within the   Aksumite kingdom since the early centuries of the Christian era. It has already   been said above that many churches in this area are attributed to the early   Christian kings of Aksum. It was also in southern Tigrai and in Angot (northern   Wollo), just next door to Wa’ag and Lasta, that the Christian kingdom had its   political center for three centuries after the decline and fall of Aksum. The   Agew peoples of these areas had therefore been profoundly acculturized by the   Aksumite kingdom, and they had even adopted Christianity as their religion. The   Agew kings of the Zagawe dynasty were therefore completely Christian from the   start. They had, however, successfully resisted complete assimilation,   particularly in a linguistic sense. Thus, although it is certain that they used   Ge’ez as the language of their church services; they apparently continued to use   their Agew mother tongue for their daily needs. Signs of this bi-linguality are   clearly seen in some of the land charters given by the Zagwe kings in Ge’ez. In   the major aspects of their rule, however, the Zagwe kings continued the cultural   and political legacy of Aksum.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong><a name="revival" id="revival"></a>REVIVAL OF THE CHURCH   (1200-1526)</strong><br></br>
    The capital of the Zagwe kings was at Adefa, at the   present site of the town of Lalibela. From here they continued the Aksumite   imperial tradition of conquest and Christian expansion here at Adefa they   received and entertained many delegations from the Patriarchate of Alexandria,   and probably also from the Muslim rulers of Egypt. Kings Yimrha and Lalibela,   the greatest kings of the Zagwe dynasty, had many such contacts with the eastern   Mediterranean region and particularly with Egypt. The traditions about the   building of the beautiful churches of Yimrahanne Kristos and the Lalibela group   of rock-hewn churches are dominated by allusions to such international contacts.   The characteristic aspects of the building of these religious monuments are   essentially loyal, however, to the best traditions of Aksumite architectural   art. Thus, although it can be surmised that the Zagwe kings may have used   artisans from the eastern Mediterranean countries, the conception of the   building was clearly indigenous and no doubt derived from the Aksumite heritage   of the Zagwe dynasty. Translations of many religious works from Arabic into   Ge’ez are also said to date from this period. Despite later traditions to the   contrary, therefore, the living achievements of the Zagwe dynasty clearly show   that the period was one of cultural and literary revival in the Christian   kingdom.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    The ‘Solomonic” Dynasty<br></br>
    This   dynasty was overthrown by Yikunno-Amlak, an Amhara warrior of the central   province of what is now Wollo, which constituted the southern part of the Zagwe   kingdom. Besides Yikunno-Amlak’s successful revolt against the Zagwe, a number   of crucial historical factors brought about this drastic political change in the   Christian kingdom.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Ever since the rise of Islam at Mecca, in the 7th century, the   Aksumite had been losing their ancient ports and islands to the increasingly,   dominant Muslim merchants of the red Sea. From these marker stations on the   seaboard, the Muslim merchants operated in the Christian highlands throughout   the early mediaeval period. They gradually made a number of local converts to   Islam, mainly in the major market villages and along the caravan routes. The   right of public worship and free trade of these local Muslim converts was   strongly championed by Muslim rulers of Egypt who could always put pressure on   the Christian Ethiopian kings through the Patriarchate of Alexandria. Until the   tenth century it is very clear that these local Muslims were few in number, and   their activities in the Ethiopian region were purely commercial in character.   After the tenth century, however, their number began to grow and many Muslim   settlements were established. These erstwhile commercial Muslim settlements   gradually assumed much political significance. This historical development was   particularly true of the hinterland of the port of Zeila which was becoming the   most important commercial outlet for the Ethiopian region. By the twelfth and   the thirteenth centuries a number of small Muslim sultanates were established   along the trade routes from Zeila to Ethiopian interior. The most important   among these were the sultanates of Shoa, Ifat, Dawaro, and Bali. Since all these   Muslim states were situated to the south and southwest of the central Ethiopian   highlands, the Zagwe kingdom was growing more and more isolated and was   receiving no benefits from the commercial exploitation of the rich regions of   southern Ethiopia. The province of Amhara lay between the seat of Zagwe power in   Lasta and these rich areas, and, when Yikunno-Amlak raised his banner of revolt   in Amhara, the isolation of the Zagwe rulers became complete.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The dynasty founded by Yikunno-Amlak in 1270 is called the   “Solomonic” dynasty. This appellation is a result of an historical process that   seems to have started in the early mediaeval period. After the decline of Aksum,   the Christian kingdom was surrounded by Muslim and pagan neighbors and was   isolated from the rest the Christian world except the Alexandrian Church. During   all this period the most important religious book in the possession of the   Ethiopians was the Holy Bible which they took much inspiration. Taking accounts   probably of the similar beleaguered circumstances, the Ethiopians began to   identify themselves with Israel, and to deliberately imitate and adopt many of   the institutions of the Old Testament. The most important expression of this   attitude is the gradual identification of the Ethiopian ruling house with the   family of king Solomon of Israel. This tradition is embodied in the Kebre   Negest, compiled in the thirteenth century, which tells the Ethiopic version of   the legend of the Queen Sheba. The Solomonic tradition was particularly   important after Yikunno-Amlak founded his dynasty. All his descendants adopted   the name of the “House of Israel”, and no one who did not belong to this house   could accede to the throne in the whole of the late mediaeval period. All the   male descendants of Yikunno-Amlak, expect the reigning monarch and his miner   sons, were kept under heavy guard on the inaccessible mountain top of Gishen.   When a king died, it was form among the detained princes on Mount Gishen that   his successor was chosen. This ingenious device gave a high degree of political   stability to the mediaeval Christian kingdom, a stability which was essential in   that period of intensive struggle with the numerous Muslim sultanates that had   been established in the south and the south-eastern part of the Ethiopian   region.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Yikunno-Amlak’s grandson, king Amde-Seyon (1314-44), dealt   effectively with these Muslim king lets in the area. His quarrel with them was   not merely religious. He wishes to control their commercial activities by   conquering the areas through which the trade routes passed, and break the   age-old isolation of his kingdom. In a series of long wars he conquered Ifat,   Dawaro, Bali, Hadya, and the pagan regions to the west and southwest of these   centers of Muslim trade. From this time on Christian kingdom maintained its   dominant position until the sixteenth century. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Just as in the preceding period of the Zagwe dynasty, the major   aspects of the social, cultural, and military organization of the mediaeval   Christian kingdom were a direct replica of the Aksumite kingdom. The “Solomonic”   kings of mediaeval Ethiopia maintained the imperial traditions of ancient Aksum   which remained their cultural and religious centre to the end of the period.   Unlike the kings of Aksum, however, they did not build fixed urban centers or   capital cities. They administered their huge unwieldy Empire from a series of   peripatetic royal camps which nevertheless had the same functions as permanent   towns or cities. This arrangement increased the mobility of the royal court, and   the effectiveness of the Christian army against local revolts. In a vast empire   with numerous big rivers, great mountains and spectacular valleys, without roads   and bridges, the task of maintaining sufficient control over their heterogeneous   subjects would have otherwise been impossible for the mediaeval kings of   Ethiopia. </p>
  <p align="justify"><strong><br></br>
    Monasticism and the Expansion of the   Church </strong></p>
  <p align="justify">It was within this historical milieu that the Church was making   its impact felt in the Ethiopian interior. It has been mentioned in the second   section above that the nine saints had instituted the earliest monasteries in   the Aksumite kingdom. It is apparent that, together with monasteries other   monastic communities later established in Tigre and Lasta, these ancient   monasteries continued to be the cultural continued to provide educational   facilities for the whole of the Ethiopian Christian leaders in mediaeval Amhara   and northern Shoa, it is very clear that any ambitious young man had to travel   all the way to northern Ethiopia to obtain any serious religious and literary   training. When they returned to their native districts, some of these men opened   small schools where they taught some of the local children how to read and   write. But until the middle of the thirteenth century, it seems that none of   these small local schools in the south attained any particular significance   beyond providing very elementary educational service for a handful of local   children.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In about 1248, however, a young monk, Iyasus-Mo’a (c.1211-1292)   came to Lake Hayq and opened a small monastic school at the island church of St.   Stephen. Iyasus-Mo’a was born in Dahna, a small district of Lasta bordering on   the River Takazze. While still a young boy, he abandoned his home district,   traveled to northern Tigre, and joined the famous monastery of Debra Damo.   There, he studied for many years under the abbot, Abba Yohanni, who later   conferred on him the monastic habits. Iyasus-Mo’a had been a very serious   student, and he had particularly distinguished himself as an outstanding   calligraphist.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">He apparently copied many books while at Debra Damo, and he is   renowned for having left a large collection of manuscripts when he died at Hayq   in 1292. The school he opened at Hayq becomes very famous as the first center of   higher Christian education south of Lasta. Many young men from the surrounding   Christian communities joined his school. According to the hagiographic tradition   about his life, one of his pupil was the founder of the “Solomonic” dynasty,   King Yikunno-Amlak (1270-1285), and there are more reliable indications that the   island monastery of Lake Hayq continued to be one of the most important cultural   centers of the “Solomonic” kings until the advent of Ahmad Gragn in the first   half of the sixteenth century.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Many of Iyasus-Mo’a’s pupils later acquired considerable fame   as monastic leaders of the Ethiopian Church. Abba Hiruta-Amlak is believed to   have been the founder of the important island monastery of Daga Estifanos on   Lake Tana. Many others are said to have founded similar monastic communities in   mediaeval Amhara and central Begemdir. One of the most outstanding pupils of   Iyasus-Mo’a was Abba Takel-Haymanot of Shoa (d.1313). He apparently joined   Iyasua-Mo’a’s school as a middle-aged man with many years of clerical service in   Shoa behind him. He spent some nine years with Iyasus-Mo’a who gave him his   first serious Christian education. After having been invested with the monastic   habits by Iyasus-Mo’a, Takel-Haymanot decided to visit the ancient monastic   centers in northern Ethiopia. He went to Debra-Damo and other places in Tigre   where he remained for over ten years. In the meantime, he undertook further   religious and monastic training and he apparently gained a much deeper insight   into the history and ecclesiastical traditions of Ethiopia. He returned to Hayq   with many followers after his long sojourn in Tigre. Iyasus-Mo’a now advised him   to go back to his native district of Shoa and start a new monastery of Debra   Libanos which has become one of the most important religious centers of   Christian Ethiopia. </p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    Similar monastic leaders were emerging during the same   period in northern Ethiopia, and they established other cultural centres. Abba   Ewostatewos (d.1352) deserves particular mention. He was apparently born in   Gar’alta, in central Tigre and he studied under his own uncle, Abba Daniel, who   was the abbot of Debra Mariam there. He then left Gar’alta and began teaching in   Sara’s, in what is today the province of Eritrea. There he was joined by many   students who later founded their own monastic centers in the area. Ewostatewos   himself was persecuted by his colleagues in the Ethiopian church for insisting   on the Biblical custom of the observance of the Sabbath, and he left his country   for Egypt, Palestine, Cyprus, and Armenia where he died after fourteen years of   self-exile. He was accompanied by some of his pupils on his foreign travels, and   some of them managed to return to Ethiopia after his death. Together with their   colleagues who had remained in northern Ethiopia, these followers of Ewostatewos   effectively organized themselves and they become one of the two monastic houses   of the Ethiopian Church. (The other is the House of Takla-Haymanot of Shoa)   important cultural and educational centers like Debra Mariam of Qohain, and   Dabra Bizan (on the eastern edge of the Hamasen plateau) were later founded by   the followers of Abba Ewostatewos. Thus, by the fifteenth century, numerous   monastic centers had been established at a number of crucial points from   northern Hamasen to Lake Zuway in the south, from the eastern edge of the   Ethiopian plateau to beyond Lake Tana in the west. And, just like the ancient   center founded by the nine Saints, the new monastic communities provided the   only educational facilities available in the Christian highlands.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>Development of Christian   literature</strong><br></br>
    Each monastic community ran a number of schools depending   on its size and its resources. A senior member of the community, specially noted   for his learning and for his exemplary character, was given charge of each of   these schools. The monasteries of Ethiopia vied among themselves for attracting   well-known teachers, and the fame and prestige of a monastery largely depended   on the quality of the teachers it employed. The courses given by each school   were of course mainly religious and they depended on the level of the   school.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    There were mainly four general levels of education in these   monastic communities. The first level concentrated on training children how to   read. They started with the Ethiopic alphabet, and they were drilled into   reading a series of increasingly difficult passages. The question of   understanding and comprehension was not important at this stage. It was strictly   a “Reading” exercise. After sunset, following the evening prayers and the   community dinner time, the children of the “reading School” were taught to   memorize and recite a series of increasingly difficult prayers. This   “memorization exercise” often went on up to midnight. </p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    The next stage was usually one in which courses in church   Music were given at different levels. Since the days of Yared, who is believed   to have been divinely inspired to compose the first notes of the distinctively   Ethiopian church Music in the Sixty century, a meticulous system of courses was   organized in this field. It is apparent that this elaborate program of musical   studies was at the height of its development in the fifteenth and the sixteenth   centuries. The Dagwa, the collection of hymns traditionally attributed to Yared   , was most probably a cumulative product of many centuries. A major aspect of   the Ethiopian Church Music in the ritual dance that always accompanies the   liturgical chant. Monneret de Villard, a well-known student of Ethiopian   Christian art and the history of the Nile Valley, has suggested that the   liturgical dance of the Ethiopians may have originated in ancient Egypt. But in   its contemporary manifestations a religious musical performance of the Ethiopian   priests is strongly reminiscent of the dancing and the rejoicing of the Levites   in front of the Ark of the Covenant (2 Sam. 6:2-5). A casual look at the musical   instruments used by the priests clearly shows that the Ethiopians have also   drawn much inspiration from the Old Testament. The whole atmosphere created   during a religious service in Ethiopia evokes the old Biblical scene transmitted   in the last chapter of the book of psalms:<br></br>
    Praise him with the sound of the   Trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp. Praise him with the timbrel and   Dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs. Praise him upon the lord   cymbals: Praise him upon the high sounding Cymbals.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    The third stage of education was usually what can be called   the “Poetry School”. It has not been possible to find out the definite origins   of this school, nor to ascertain the earliest period of its establishment. But   there is no doubt that it had already developed by the fifteenth century, and it   constituted one of the advanced level of education in Christian Ethiopia. The   most important aim of this school was to increase the level of comprehension of   the Church scholar and to make him a master of the Ethiopic Grammar. An   essential element of the training here is drilling the student to compose poems   of different level. In the evening, the student recited before his master the   poems he had composed for the day, and the master commented on the form and the   aesthetic qualities of the poems. When the student reached a tolerable degree of   excellence the master promoted him to the next level. After all the students had   finished reciting their poems, they gathered around the master who composed   spontaneously a series of original poems. These were often known for their   outstanding qualities in both form and content, qualities which the student vied   among themselves to master explained what he meant by the lines of the poem, and   this was followed by groups of his students meticulously analyzing with him each   of the words of every line to appreciate their grammatical and syntactical place   in the poem. This session often went on well beyond midnight every day, and it   was the major occasion when the scholars could have the personal guidance of   their master. To pass through the eight or nine stages of this “Poetry School” a   student often needed more than two years; but if the scholar had the intention   of becoming a master himself, he usually spent as many as ten years visiting as   many different masters as possible. The “Poetry School” was one of the most   prestigious institutions to have gone through, and its inmates could hope for   some of the highest positions in both Church and State.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    The next and last stage was the mastery of the   interpretations of all the canonical books of the Church. The Ethiopian clergy   had developed an elaborate system of analytical studies of each of the books of   the Old and New Testaments. The Canons of the Church were also studied in the   same meticulous fashion with a lot of legal hair-splitting. These studied were   so detailed that there was sometimes a special master for each of the Books of   the Old and New Testaments, as well as for some of the apocryphal works of the   Church.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br></br>
    These were the different stages of education in mediaeval   Ethiopia. Although the content of the program was strictly religious, there is   no doubt that it solved the essential problem of developing the intellectual   faculties of the scholar, and it prepared him for specific roles in the   mediaeval Ethiopian community. What is more important is that the graduates of   the monastic school system were employed not only in the Church but in all   various administrative, judicial, and other department of the State. Nor was it   with the limited prospect of leadership in the Church that students went to   those schools. Indeed many of the royal princes who later ascended the throne   –kings like Dawit (1380 -1412), Zar’a Ya’iqob (1434-68), and Na’od (1494-1508)   are known to have attended such schools. Zar’a Ya’iqob and Na’od were   particularly noted for their considerable scholarship, and they were the authors   of a number of important original compositions in the Ethiopic language.   Prolific writers such as King Zar’a Ya’iqob and Abba Giyorgis of Gascha were   products of the great monastic schools of the fifteenth century. The literary   and artistic achievements of mediaeval Ethiopia were indeed outstanding. Many   translations from Arabic, and numerous original Ge’ez works date from that   period. A short visit to the Museum of the Institute of Ethiopia studies at   Haile Sellassie I University also gives some idea of the works of Christian art   of those times. The library collections of the numerous island and mainland   monasteries throughout Christian Ethiopia, even today, are a living testimony to   the splendor of cultural life in mediaeval Ethiopia.</p>
