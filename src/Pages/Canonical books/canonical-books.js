  <p align="center" class="style1">The Bible </p>
  <p align="justify">The Holy Scriptures are one of the two great foundations of the   faith and here is what our church holds and teaches concerning it. The word of   God is not contained in the Bible alone, it is to be found in tradition as well.   The Sacred Scriptures are the written word of God who is the author of the Old   and New Testaments containing nothing but perfect truth in faith and morals. But   God’s word is not contained only in them, there is an unwritten word of God   also, which we call apostolic tradition. We receive the one and other with equal   veneration.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="justify">The Ethiopic version of the Old and New Testament was made from   the Septuagint. It includes the book of Enoch, Baruch, and the third and fourth   Esdras. In the international Bible studies there are certain books belonging to   the class usually designated pseudepigraphic. The whole Christendom and   whole-learned world owes a debt of gratitude to the church of Ethiopia for the   preservation of those documents. </p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Among these books is the book of Enoch which throws so much   light on Jewish thought on various points during the centuries immediately   preceding the Christian era. The book of Jubilee (Kufale, i.e. Division)   otherwise known as the Little Genesis has also been preserved entire only in the   Ethiopic version. The preservation of yet one more book in its entity, namely,   the Ascension of Isaiah, is to be remembered to the credit of the Ethiopic   Church. </p>

  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify"><strong>14. Ancient grammatical books</strong></p>
  <p align="justify">There are very many grammatical books written by different   people and found at different places in the world. The above noted are but a   very few examples from among the different books numbered by the thousands that   the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church has. In the past, at present and even in   the future either in the church or at the schools what the church uses for   educational services was and will not be outside of these books.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In the past, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church had not   much opportunity to expand and propagate the above, noted doctrine and orders of   the church inside and outside the nation; this is because of the different   circumstances prevailing in the surroundings of the country. Because of the   advent of European Colonialism upon its neighboring African countries and the   great monetary support that other religious groups received to convert Africans.   The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had no other choice but to defend on and preserve   all here Christian legacy. Henceforth, she was unable to raise her apostolic   voice louder among her African brothers and sisters. Nevertheless, the sense of   freedom that the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church maintained for centuries   being, the torch of freedom to all Africa has enabled Africans to be aware of   their freedom.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">In this 20th century, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church is   conducting many apostolic missions – that is organizing church councils and   founding clergy training programs within the country; and carrying on her   apostolic missionary activities.</p>
  <p align="justify"><br/>
      <strong>CANON LAW</strong><br/>
    The canons, regulations of   Christian instruction and worship of the Ethiopian Church, are contained in the   Sinodos and Didascalia, two compilations of ancient church canons, dating from   the second period of Ethiopic literature. These canons are closely associated   with the New Testament.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Sinodos, classed as part of Ethiopic New Testament, is   composed of various elements: Constitutions of Apostles, the Statutes of the   Apostles, the Canons of the Apostles, the canons of Various councils-Nicaea,   Gangra, Sardica, Antioch, New-Caesarca, Aneyra, Laodienea – and various   theological and pastoml treatises. Eight books make up the Sinodos. Sinodos is   the Corpus juris Ecclesiastic of the Church. The various discourses and treaties   included in this Corpus are:</p>
  <p align="justify">1. An exposition of the dialogue ascribed to St. John   Chrysostom.<br/>
    2. On the Essence of the Holy Trinity.<br/>
    3. On the fear of   God.<br/>
    4. On the ancient people and a refutation of the Jews.<br/>
    5. A discourse   of St. Gregory of Armenia against the Jews.<br/>
    6. Hortatory discourse to   believers who desire to walk in the paths of wisdom and knowledge.<br/>
    7.   Hortatory discourse to believers who desire to walk in the paths of wisdom and   knowledge.<br/>
    8. The discourse of the Nicene Fathers on the Holy Trinity.<br/>
    9.   The penitential canons of our Lord to Peter.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">The Didascalia a document well known in the Christian Church   originally composed in Greek probably in the middle of the third century, a   discourse on Church life and society. The whole work was afterwards, somewhere   in the fourth century, incorporated in the Apostolic Constitutions. It has   Latin, Arabic and Syriac versions, which differ among themselves and from the   Ethiopic version with regard to the subject matter. The Ethiopia Didascalia   contains the first seven books of the Apostolic Constitutions and it represents   a form intermediate between the shorter Syriac Didascalia and the complete work   of Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="justify">Briefly the contents of the document are: Questions of   morality, the duty of studying the Scriptures and observance of the Seventh   Commandment, mutual duties of husband and wife, offices and duties of Christian   ministers; the duties of widows; the method of baptism, laymen not to baptize;   vows of virginity; the duties of the faithful towards the martyrs; observance of   Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, Holy week and method of calculating the date of   Easter; warning against heresy; respect to be shown to the faithful departed;   prayers to be used on specified and unspecified occasions. </p>
