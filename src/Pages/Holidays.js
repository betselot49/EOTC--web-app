                        <br />
                        The calendar of the Ethiopian church came from Egypt and
                        as to methods and dates agrees with the calendar of the
                        Coptic Church. But the two calendars differ with regard
                        to the saints’ days and the time of observing them. The
                        year of the Ethiopian calendar contains 365 days to
                        which is added every fourth year an extra day. Each year
                        in this four-year period is dedicated to one of the four
                        Evangelists who come in the following order: Mathew,
                        Mark, Luke and John. The year of Luke is the Ethiopian
                        Leap year and is the year which precedes the western
                        leap year.{" "}

                        Each year is divided into 12 months of 30 days. The
                        extra 5 days are placed at the end of the year and known
                        as Pagumen. In the leap year the extra day is added to
                        these five days making the Pagumen of this year a period
                        of 6 days.{" "}

                        The chronology of the Ethiopian church follows the Era
                        of Incarnation that is it dates from our Lord’s birth;
                        there is a difference of 7 or 8 years between the
                        western and Ethiopian systems. Because the Ethiopian
                        church holds that our Lord was born 5500 years after the
                        creation of the world this gives the 7 or 8 years
                        difference between the Gregorian and Ethiopian
                        Chronologies.{" "}

                      <p align="justify">
                        The church also uses other systems of chronology. There
                        is the Era of the world which dates from 5493 B.C, which
                        also differs from the western chronology by 7 or 8
                        years. Then there is a system of chronology called “the
                        years of Mercy or Grace,” a system which follows the
                        great lunar cycle.{" "}

                        based upon the system of Ammonius. The dates of Easter
                        and the feast which depends upon it are determined by

                        <br />
                        The Church, in her earliest days, recognized the
                        necessity for her children to “chastise the body and
                        br/ing it under subjection”, as St. Paul advises. The
                        body is ever striving for mastery over the spirit;
                        besides the external sources of temptation, “the world”,
                        we have always another source with us which is a part of
                        our nature. This is the reason for mortification. Self
                        denial is in lawful things enables us to turn with great
                        earnestness to spiritual things. It is on these grounds
                        that the Ethiopian church has strictly adhered to the
                        injunctions of the Didascalia and enjoyed on the
                        faithful the longest and most austere fasts in the
                        world.{" "}

                      <p align="justify">
                        Fasting implies abstention from food and drink. Special
                        days are appointed for fasting. Every Wednesday and
                        Friday are days of fasting because on Wednesday the Jews
                        held a council in which they rejected and condemned our
                        Lord and on Friday they crucified him. The fasts are

                        2. Fast of the Apostles, 10-40 days, which the Apostles
                        kept after they had received the Holy Spirit. It begins
                        after Pentecost.
                        <br />
                        3. The fast of Assumption, 16 days.
                        <br />
                        4. The gahad of Christmas (on the eve of Christmas).
                        <br />
                        5. The fast preceding Christmas, 40 days. It begins with
                        Sibket on 15th Hedar and ends on Christmas eve with the
                        feast of Gena and the 28th of Tahsas.
                        <br />
                        6. The fast of Nineveh, commemorating the preaching of
                        Jonah. It comes on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of the
                        third week before Lent. <br />
                        7. The gahad of Epiphany, fast on the eve of Epiphany.

                        as a penance by the priest for seven days, forty days or
                        one year. There is a fast which a bishop keeps at the

                        he will subdue his body by extra good works. Monks and
                        nuns observe additional fast days not required of the
                        laity. All persons above the age of 13 observe the
                        church fasts. The priest rarely grants dispensations.
                        The man who ignores or neglects any injunction of the
                        church is not considered good Christian.{" "}

                        groups in the church. The longest periods of fasting are
                        those of Lent. Advent and Kweskwam (forty days preceding
                        the fast of the flight to Egypt). Fast generally implies

                        after 2.45 p.m. with total abstention from meat, fats,

                        discrepancy since the Ethiopian calendar is based on the
                        year of Grace 7 or 8 years after Anno Domini. The
                        Ethiopian Christmas coincides with the date of this
                        observance in the Eastern Orthodox dispensation.{" "}

                        The church has always taught the necessity of penance
                        for justification. She has instituted Lent as a
                        remembr/ance of the forty days fast of our Blessed Lord
                        in the desert and as a means of sanctification for her

                        To the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Lent means a period of
                        fasting when the faithful undergo a rigorous schedule of
                        prayers and penitence. This fast is observed with
                        greater rigor than any other fast and it is a test of
                        one’s Christianity. One who fails to keep it is not
                        considered a good Christian. Properly observed in
                        nullifies the sins committed during the rest of the
                        year. The faithful should abstain from all food except
                        br/ead, water and salt. It consists of 56 days. All
                        kinds of meat is forbidden, and also diary products. On
                        all the fasting days only one meal is allowed and this
                        is to be taken in the afternoon, at 3 p.m. or in the
                        evening. On Saturdays and Sundays people are allowed to
                        eat in the morning.{" "}

                        . The solemn liturgical service of Good Friday is
                        attended by thousands of believers. There is a sense of
                        sorrow and desolation. All the symbols, images and
                        instruments used in the passion of the Saviour are
                        publicly exhibited in the church. Men and women go to
                        church to prostrate themselves, remaining there from
                        early morning till 3 p.m. the hour of the death of Jesus
                        Christ. Believers confess their greater and lesser
                        offenses to the confessor or sit reading their Psalter.
                        It is believed that on Good Friday blood fell from
                        Christ on the cross and dripped into the grave of Adam
                        beneath and there rose up from the dead about 500
                        people; the thief on the left was sent into darkness but
                        the one on the right went before Adam into Paradise. On
                        this Friday the Devil was bound with cords and Christ
                        descending to purgatory (seol) sent forth to paradise
                        all the souls that were in darkness (Seol). Good Friday
                        is a special day for confession.{" "}

                        prostration on clenched hands. Confession is heard on

                        in their best vestments. All the people hold lighted
                        tapers. Greetings are exchanged, drums are beaten, hands
                        are clapped and singing is heard everywhere: “our
                        resurrection has come, hosanna.” Men are heard saying “O
                        Lord Christ have mercy upon us.” They pray for a
                        blessing “O God make it to be a festival of our good
                        fortune and of our well being! Let us have another
                        threshing floor and another year if thou wilt.” Letters
                        or messages are exchanged between friends and the whole
                        day is one of spiritual and physical feasting, a
                        commemoration of the holiest occasion of all history – a
                        truly blessed time when Christ rose from the dead.
